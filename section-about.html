        <p class="about-text">
          We live in an age of unparalleled abundance and chances. Globalization, technology, and 
          capitalism have created countless new paths in our world. These market opportunities and 
          technological advancements have not only removed the need for many labor-intensive tasks, 
          they have also created ways for us to financially support ourselves and our families while 
          doing things that excite us and make us feel the most fulfilled.

          What the previous generations thought about work is starkly different from what work means
          today. The collective definition and ideas surrounding work--the opportunities, limitations,
          feelings, and attitudes--have been drastically evolving.
