      <p>
        We believe that continuous learning and self-improvement are the keys to success. 
        We believe that there is no outsmarting hard work. We believe in embracing a positive
        attitude and being thankful for even the smallest things in life. We believe that
        we are all capable of aiming higher and achieving the impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, these beliefs form our 4Gs--Outgive’s core values. With <span 
        class="font-bold">growth, grit, gratitude,</span> and <span class="font-bold">
        greatness,</span> we’re breaking down the barriers of our personal 
        capabilities and testing the limitations of our industry overall.

      <h3 class="mission-title">Core Competencies</h3>
      <p>
        We are constantly looking for people who embody our core competencies. 
        Our 4Cs--<span class="font-bold">capability, character, creativity,</span>
        and <span class="font-bold">communication</span>--drive us
        to a culture of excellence, personal development, collaboration, and belonging.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we highly value ability and talent, we equally prize a positive
        attitude and being a team player. After all, we believe that the
        pinnacle of personal success is being able to help others achieve the same thing too.

      <p>
        These 4Gs and 4Cs fuel Outgive’s culture of high-performance that 
        encourages personal and team growth, while also instilling a sense 
        of safety and belonging in all our members. Although impossible to 
        quantify, our company culture is felt through loyalty, team spirit,
       and our enthusiasm to help one another accomplish great things.

      <p>
        We believe that fostering a culture that emphasizes teamwork, collaboration,
         and compassion is the key to a never-ending cycle of advancement.
         We raise each other up because we don’t settle for good enough, even if
         it means leaving our comfort zones. At Outgive, we’re continuously looking
         for ways to push ourselves to the limit to achieve even more growth and greater results than ever before.
